## Task Prioritization Framework

Each task in the implementation checklist is prioritized according to the following framework:

### Priority Levels
- **[P0]** - **Critical Path**: Essential for system functionality; blocking for other tasks
- **[P1]** - **High Priority**: Core functionality; should be implemented early
- **[P2]** - **Medium Priority**: Important but not blocking; can be implemented after P0/P1
- **[P3]** - **Low Priority**: Nice-to-have features; can be deferred if needed

### Development Principles
1. **Accuracy First**: Processing accuracy takes precedence over speed/performance
2. **Iterative Implementation**: Build minimal working versions before optimization
3. **Component Integration**: Regularly test integration points between system components
4. **User Experience**: Prioritize reliable operation over feature completeness

Tasks should be approached in priority order (P0→P1→P2→P3) within each milestone phase.
